**소개:**
현대의 빠른 디지털 세상에서 깊은 영적 연구를 위한 시간을 찾는 것이 어려울 수 있습니다. 그래서 우리는 강력한 성경적 가르침을 모바일에 최적화된 작은 크기로 전달하는 "성령 안에서 걷기" YouTube Shorts 시리즈를 만들었습니다.

- 로마서 8:14: "무릇 하나님의 영으로 인도함을 받는 그들은 곧 하나님의 아들이라"

**주요 학습 포인트:**
1. 성령 안에서 걷는다는 것이 무엇을 의미하는지 이해
2. 육체 안에서 걷는 것과 성령 안에서 걷는 것의 차이
3. 성령 인도하심을 받는 삶을 위한 실용적인 단계
4. 영적 성장을 위한 성경적 기초
5. 하나님의 성령에게 자신의 의지를 항복하는 방법
